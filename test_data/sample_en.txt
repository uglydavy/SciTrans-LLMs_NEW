Machine Learning and Deep Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data without explicit programming. Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns.

Key Concepts:
- Training Data: Examples used to teach the model
- Validation Set: Data used to tune hyperparameters
- Test Set: Final evaluation data

Mathematical Foundation:
The loss function $L(\theta)$ measures model performance. Gradient descent minimizes loss:
$\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \alpha \nabla L(\theta_t)$

Applications include:
1. Computer vision
2. Natural language processing
3. Speech recognition
4. Recommender systems
